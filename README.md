# Uber vs Bus
This is a MEAN stack project. The app uses Uber and Nextbus API to get the arriving time of the upcoming buses and the arriving time and price of Uberpool. When the "Make decision" is clicked, the app will suggest whether the user should take uber or bus. In some case, the users will decide by themselves. 

This app is only for personal use. Users are required to login in their Uber account to use this app.
